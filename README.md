Teaching Snippets

These are example programs used in my classes to teach basic programming concepts.
They are focused on simplicity, and usually to illustrate a single concept.

Mostly, this section is used for students to download example code, and learn how to use modern source control tools.

These snippets are not work-ready, often omit error checking, and are probably sub-optimal for the problem space specified.
